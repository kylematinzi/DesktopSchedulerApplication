A3f Description:
	For this part I created a report called "Who's Working". When the report is
opened it displays a pie chart filled with users and appointment counts from the database.
What it shows is how many appointments each user has scheduled and what percentage that 
number is out of the total amount of appointments scheduled in the database. This 
report is accessed through the homescreen just after login, along with the contact 
report next to it. The appointment report is located on the top right hand corner of the all
appointments screen.
